REQUIREMENTS:
- The tattoo ink appears absorbed into the skin surface — follows skin curves, contours, and lighting
- Match the lighting direction and shadows from the body
- Preserve the tattoo's linework, detail, and proportions exactly — do not alter the design
- Tattoo edges blend seamlessly into the surrounding skin — no borders or sticker effect
- Scale the tattoo anatomically for the body part
- Add subtle skin highlights and shadows over the tattoo for realism

OUTPUT: Photorealistic tattoo portfolio quality — the kind of photo a professional tattoo studio would post to showcase their work.

Render the tattoo as genuinely inked onto the skin:
- Use image 1 for exact placement — keep the tattoo at precisely that position, size, and angle
- Use image 2 for design accuracy — preserve every line and element of the tattoo faithfully
- Use image 3 for skin realism — match the natural lighting, shadows, and skin texture
- The tattoo ink sits absorbed into the skin — not floating, not pasted on
- Tattoo edges fade seamlessly into surrounding skin, no harsh borders
- Output is a natural photograph of a real tattoo — same framing and background as image 3
